I just saw someone using a leaf blower to move grass cuttings out of the gutter... simply blowing them onto the road...

What the...?
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>So you used some energy to cut the grass - sure.. you want short grass, that I can understand...</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>But then you used more energy (petrol in this case) to blow the grass cuttings onto the street?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>The wind is just going to blow them back again...</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">**What a waste!**</p>

Its a mundane example, but it illustrates my point:
**We've stopped thinking about what we're doing**

We use energy like it has no impact...

Well **start thinking again** because **your actions have an impact**

Find the things you do that waste energy
Then stop doing them

I noticed that now I have a car, I drive to my girlfriends place regularly
A ten minute drive where I used to take the bus or train..

So I've decided that I'm going to try running or biking there instead
Its a simple change (and for me not a huge inconvenience) which should reduce my carbon footprint

I don't expect everyone to stop driving all the time
Find ways to save energy which work for you.. then share them

Find new ways to do things
Stop doing things which just waste energy
**Keep thinking about what you're doing** :)
