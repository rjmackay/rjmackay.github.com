It's been too long between posts so here is a quote to hold the space:

> This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognised by yourself as the mighty one; the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.
> 
> **I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can.**
> 
> I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.

> -- **George Bernard Shaw**
