How much pain, confusion and conflict in the world is caused by mis-understandings about love?



If you take the position that love is not the same thing is commitment, love doesn't mean a relationship will work. **Love is just love. It's not conditional, until we make it conditional. **What changes if you assume love is unconditional? What if you give you love unconditionally?



If your relationship breaks down, if things in your relationship are not working, it doesn't mean they don't love you anymore, or you don't love each other anymore. They will always love you, they always have. You can still love them, you always have, you always will..



The relationship in its current from just doesn't work.

It still hurts. It's still hard.

Be sad, do resist it - but then move on.



This extends to friendships too... you don't have to pretend you can make a relationship work and be friends with someone when you can't. There is no shame in admitting you can't deal with someone, it doesn't make you a smaller person, in fact it makes you larger for admitting the truth.

Remember too, you don't have to take your love away from someone if things don't work. But you don't have to continue the relationship the same way, just to prove you love them.

<div>Does the heartbreak really matter? It's hurts, sure. But its easier to take.</div>

<em>I'm not saying this is the truth. You don't have believe it if you don't like. If it doesn't work for you, don't worry about it.

It's just a place to stand, a powerful place to stand if it works for you.Â What If you assume love is unconditional?</em>
