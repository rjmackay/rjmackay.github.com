I've just been reading the excerpt from <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a> - it looks like this will be a fantastic book so I recommend you check it out. Ordering my own copy might wait till I move to the UK or until I have an e-book reader. But here's my thoughts from the excerpt:



Meetings can be a colossal waste of time.



But we often do need to meet with people - at least to avoid distractions while working on something.



So what about micro meetings? 15mins max. Focused on just one issue.



I'm sure this has been suggested before. But has anyone tried this out?



How did it go?



It still suffers from mental switching costs: breaking out of what you're doing and going somewhere else to meet. But it's better than the 'normal' model of meetings and it's probably easier to sell to other people you work (compared with just no meetings).
