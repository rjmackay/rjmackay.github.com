I spend a lot of time just consuming new ideas: reading blogs, twitter, books, watching TED talks... theres a lot of information out there.



And yet until recently blog was sitting stagnant.



I came up with the idea to use it as an incentive:

When I feel like consuming - I'm at a loose end, the automatic response is just to read blogs for a while.

Don't. **Publish instead.**



Write something.



If I'm struggling with a problem.

Procrastinating.

Write about it.



I decided I'd try this for a week. And it's been 2 weeks now.

I'm not doing it religiously but it got me started blogging again.

I'm still reading other blogs - but only a few key ones - and only when I actually have time - not when procrastinating.



Try it out.



Leave a comment and let me know if this worked for you too.

Or just tell me what strategies you have instead.
