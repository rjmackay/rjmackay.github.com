Whats the biggest thing frustrating me right now? I'm tried of doing things half baked.

Context switching: my todo list for this week has project scoping, World vision dev and management, V3 dev and management, Security audits…
4 Different areas of focus, both dev and management tasks to juggle. This doesn't work. I've the better part of my days this week
just trashing trying to figure out what to do next. Or trying to reduce the stress enough to concentrate.

I started seriously considering other jobs again this week.

I want to keep working here, I want to be able to work on these problems: crisis response, activism, freedom.. but its feels futile when
we execute badly.

Trying to do too much? maybe.. we try to do all the little things and many big things. Rather than cutting back and focusing on shipping
just 1 major product and shipping it well. We acknowledge this as an issue, but do nothing. Worse: we add more things (think big/crisis.net)
when the evidence suggests we can't deliver on that and deliver quality.

Failing to let people focus? probably. We set people up to do multiple jobs. We don't give people a specific project and let them do
that to the exclusion of all else.

What can I do?

* refuse new tasks: new projects, side tasks

Is there another side to this dip?

* if we can get the security stuff done, and refuse to do more
* if we can get V3 out, sunset 2.x
* If we can hire new people for ushahidi cloud
* if we can avoid ush cloud being 2 products
* if I can push new projects to other devs

We'll still be scattered, but V3 could be great.
