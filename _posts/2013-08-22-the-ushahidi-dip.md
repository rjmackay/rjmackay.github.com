I started seriously considering other jobs again this week.

Reposting and building on something I posted internally at Ushahidi:

> We are all burnt out and overstretched. And we’re already trying to deliver ‘think big’ goals without the funding and staffing.
>
> We don’t get angry when we have enough time and space to do good work. We do when we’re up against a wall and trying to deliver more than is possible.
>
> I think we need to do less. As a company we desperately need to reduce our scope: deliver fewer things, but deliver our best work.

I want to keep working here
I really want to keep working on these problems – on crisis response, on transparency, on activism – and to deliver great work, to delight our community. All the things we’re working on are important, but it doesn’t matter how important they are if we can’t execute well.

My todo list this weeks covers new external projects, world vision, V3 and security audits. The context switching is costing most of my time: thrashing, figuring out what I need to do next. I’m getting things done, but slowly and badly. .. and I doubt this is just me, I think this is normal for most of us.

We’re all set up to do multiple jobs and cover multiple projects. We don’t give people a specific project and let them do that to the exclusion of all else.

> While everybody knows how expensive context switching is, it’s staggering that nobody builds that into their organization as a constraint. With total focus, you build one thing, ship it, and then are able to move onto something else.

I’m not sure how we get there, but I think we need to push to reduce context switching. And reduce workload and the stress that comes with it..

Maybe this is just Ushahidi hitting [The Dip](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/ "The Dip"). It's a touch patch we have to push through to get to the good stuff, to be able to actually deliver something amazing.

Is there a good side after this?

Well lets do some maths..

Currently
Projects: Ushahidi 2.x, Ushahidi 3.x, Crowdmap New, Crowdmap Classic, Mobile, External projects, BRCK : 7
Devs: ~7 (trying to consider the dedicated devs.. but its a little loose) 
*We've just barely got 1 dev per project.*

So if:
- we get Ushahidi 3.0 out, and sunset 2.x
- we can close Crowdmap classic and launch Ushahidi in the cloud

The picture after getting that stuff out is still 6+ products being supported (Crowdmap, Ushahidi Cloud, Ushahidi 3.x.. +Mobile +Consulting +BRCK?). We barely have more than 1 dev per project (I'm ignoring those who aren't dedicate dev.. so 7 devs, 6 projects). This is still a problem..

I think with 3 devs per project we might start to see things move. But thats a shift from 7 devs to 18. Even 2 devs per project is almost doubling our numbers. I think that kind of growth could happen.. but I don't see it happening quickly.
