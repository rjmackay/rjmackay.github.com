We're reviewing some of our funding metrics at Ushahidi again.. these are targets we have to hit to unlock particular blocks of funding. Reading through them.. I think we need to spend more time refining these next year. We tried to at the beginning of this year, and were limited by what we can measure. But we also didn't come at it from a goals perspective.

We have an annual meeting to set milestones and goals etc, but our metrics are mostly built around what was easy to measure, not what we were trying to do. ie. we have many metrics for number of deployments or number of posts. These are great but they miss some key details:

* Quality of deployments
* Usability of the platform.

We're investing a lot this year in redoing Ushahidi core to add new features, improve workflows and make deployments more effective. But I'm not sure where this fits in these figures? and going forward how will we measure success for Ushahidi 3.0?

How do we measure deployment effectiveness/usefullness? Some ideas:

* Number of major deployments? (ie. deployment above a threshold for reports/traffic/lifetime)
*
