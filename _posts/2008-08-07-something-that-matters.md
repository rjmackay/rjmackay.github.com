I want to do something that matters.

I have little or no interest in writing software, designing embedded systems or doing anything that I know how to do just to make money or because I know how to do it.
I just want to do something that matters.

Yes I want to make money. I want to get paid.

But I want to be paid to make a difference... to do something that matters..
