**Do less, Impact more**



That's  what I came up with when trying to squeeze my current ideas into 4 words for a recent <a title="Young Professionals - Leading the change" href="http://intersect.ning.com">Intersect</a> meetup.



It is in part I was inspired by this <a title="Who gets to decide what you want?" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/08/who-gets-to-decide-what-you-want.html">recent post</a> by Seth Godin.



I keep saying I'm busy and don't have time to do things, but yet I'm spending a lot of my 'non work' time either doing things I feel a duty to do, instead of the things I really want to do.



So over the next few months, I'm going to endeavour to start doing less of the things I just do automatically or out of duty.



This doesn't mean I'm just going to abandon things I'm expected to do (like fixes for old clients).

- That wouldn't serve me or anyone else very well

But I'm going to start tieing up the loose ends: fixing problems properly, so I only do it once.



If I still have to do something I'm not excited about, I want to do it consciously not just as an automatic reaction.



Basically I'm aiming to discover how much free time I really have and then be able to dedicate that to things I'm really passionate about.
