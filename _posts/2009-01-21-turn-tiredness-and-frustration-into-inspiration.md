**Worn out? tired? frustrated?...**

For me this is common.
Its happens when I find all my energy and drive going nowhere.

Turn that energy into something worthwhile...

**What can you do right now?**

What can you do today?

What have you been waiting for time to do?

What have you been putting off?

Don't sit round being unproductive or trying to finish the task that's frustrating you...

Take 5 mins, 15 mins, an hour... Take as long as you need or can...
Do something else...

**Turn your energy into something great...**

Maybe you have a project you've been waiting to start?

You've been meaning to make a loan on <a href="http://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>?

You want to volunteer your time? (<a href="http://donatenz.co.nz">donatenz.co.nz</a>)

Go for it!

**Do it now!**

You might find completing that frustrating task much easier afterwards...
