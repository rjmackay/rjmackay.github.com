Another repost of my <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/transitions/comment-page-1/#comment-22752">blog comments</a>:

> Thank you so much for this.
> I’m about to move to the UK from New Zealand, I have 1 week of work left… working what has been my dream job for Greenpeace NZ. And part of me really doesn’t want to go.
>
> I’m excited about the trip and work in the UK is looking promising… but I don’t want to lose the community I’ve got here
>
> Except if I stayed I’d probably be restless still.
>
> So I’m leaving the office, with people I’d consider family… and I’ll hold on as long as I can… but eventually it will be time to go…
>
> Change is great.. and change sucks sometimes too.

And a quote from the <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/transitions">original post</a> by Chris Guillebeau:

> I say: **hold on to the moment as long as you can**. Fight for it if you have to. Get up early and stay up late. Be brave. Choose the raw emotion, even the awkwardness if necessary. If we must go on to something else, let’s at least think about what was and what could have been.

> The more intense the feeling, the better. If synchronicity and the feeling of **being part of something meaningful comes with sadness, loneliness, and disappointment, so be it**. I just know that I don’t want the alternative—mediocrity, routine, the safe and the comfortable.
