My alarm goes off early.. I jump out of bed, a bit groggy and head for a quick 2 min shower.
Grab breakfast - bowl of serial
Make coffee
Head straight up to my office.
Open up the laptop, sign in and wait..


Check a few emails, start to catch up on skype chats from last night.. keep waiting.

Ping someone else: Is this call on?

5 mins longer.. still no call.

Check the calendar: Yup it's right there in mine, good good.

Check the team calendar.. OH **it was 5 F\*\*King hours ago..**

### This is remote working..

Sometimes this is just how it goes. There are more than 20 of us, spread over 7 countries, we hit 6 or 7 timezones. Most of us work from home or a coworking space. We can't all talk daily. Not even in chat. Some days you just don't overlap. We can't run video on our team calls: the bandwidth just doesn't hold up to that.

Our teams aren't always grouped together: Crowdmap has 1 person in the US and 1 in South Korea. Ushahidi 3.0 has developers in Atlanta, Greensboro, Nairobi, Cape Town and Auckland.

Sometimes I think we're mad. But then I likely couldn't work here if we didn't work this way.

I get to live in New Zealand, close to family, often working at home with my 1 yr old son. I get to work on open source software every day, With amazing users mapping corruption, environmental pollution, tracking violence and much more.

### Making it work

Remote working is hard, and takes work.

It widens our pool for hiring, but we also have to make it pleasant and workable or we'll lose them as quickly.

I'm always on the look out for ways to improve our communication and process (recently subscribing to [wide teams podcast](http://wideteams.com)). However many articles often leave me more frustrated than not. They gloss over the details, or only relate work from home but not geographically distributed teams.


### But its still awesome.

All of us at Ushahidi care deeply about the work we do. Maybe we'd be more effective if we were all in one office, or even just one country. But then I couldn't work here.. and we'd be limited to hiring only local developers, and we'd be limited in who we partner with.
