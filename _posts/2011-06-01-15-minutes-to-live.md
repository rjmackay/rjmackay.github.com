*Kill every distraction. Everything in the way. What is there to communicate?*

I love you all. What else can be said?

Do not miss me. Do not mourn me. But celebrate the glorious life you all helped me to have.. I only hope someone will continue to fight for the things I fought for. Selfish? maybe.. but what better time to than now, if I really had 15mins to live. What better time for generosity and thanks too?

Fight for the planet, fight for life, fight for all those who are trodden on and ignored.

I will love you always.. more than I've ever said or shown. I've told some of you many times, and some of you never at all.
But I love you. I will miss you. I only wish for one more hug. One more chance to show you who  I am.. to beg forgiveness for every pain I've caused you, and to thank you for all you've given me. For being there for me, for loving me, for things said, advice given, good times had, bad times shared. For being angry at me when I was unkind, when I needed reminding who I was. Thank you for being you.

Thanks Mum and Dad for bringing me life, and showing me how to live it. I may not have always done things you expected, followed paths you choose, but I followed lessons you taught, one way or another. I took life and made what I would of it.. Thanks to you. I've made it this far, and I'm proud of what I've done, what I've attempted, and what I've failed at. Thanks to you.. the best guides I know in this life. You have my love and my admiration always..
