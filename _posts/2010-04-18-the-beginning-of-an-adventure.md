I can feel the beginning of an adventure
creeping in at the edges of my life, myÂ consciousness
I don't know where it is or how to get there
But this longing is back
with joy and love and beauty
I realise now this feeling
is not a hole to be filled
It's a miracle to be embraced and enjoyed
The more I experience it, I feel free, hungry to explore.
