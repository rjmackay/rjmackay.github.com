A collection of technical, management and other thoughts from this week.

Life happened and I've missed a couple weeks but I'm back at writing these. 

## Thinking

I changed roles in January, moving from a management role to a developer role. I choose an engineering role partly because I wanted to learn and grow my technical skills again, but partly I just wanted to feel like I'd done something at the end of each day.

As a manager, I often finished the day wondering what I'd done or feeling like maybe I didn't actually do anything useful at all today. I only recently realised thats a common experience for many new managers. It's harder to see your impacts as a manager, and part of becoming a good manager is figuring out how to judge your impact.

I've recently found myself in a similar place again. I'm not managing a team, but we're in a phase of open-ended exploratory work. Once again, it's hard to tell if what I did today was useful. Did I read anything that gave me insight into the product, or customers needs? Even if I did, was that enough? Is it actually moving us closer to a profitable business? I'm just ... not sure. In abscence of a concrete deliverable ie. a working bit of code, it's hard to see my impact.

I've read a couple of [good](https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work "Satisfaction and progress in open ended work") [pieces](https://blog.coleadership.com/how-to-make-sense-of-your-impact-when-youre-no-longer-coding/ "How to Make Sense of Your Impact When You're No Longer Coding") talking about this, and I've started trying out some personal processes. I've set high level goals: pick an idea in 2 weeks, build and test a prototype in a month. My daily tasks are partly reactive: follow up X, and partly driven by those goals: sketch a lean canvas for Y idea or answer a question about idea Z. It's early days but it's helped a little. I have some idea if I'm seeing progress now.

## Reading

[Satisfaction and progress in open ended work](https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work).

[How to Make Sense of Your Impact When You're No Longer Coding](https://blog.coleadership.com/how-to-make-sense-of-your-impact-when-youre-no-longer-coding/ "How to Make Sense of Your Impact When You're No Longer Coding"). 

[Hiring and the market for lemons](https://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/ "Hiring and the market for lemons"). An interesting analysis of broken hiring practices. I'm not sure I agree with all of it but it's worth a read.

[How not to disagree](http://boz.com/articles/disagree.html "How not to disagree"). A good piece about how to handle managing a team through changes you don't agree with. 

[Fire fixation](https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/ "https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/"). I've definitely had teams stuck in a place of fighting so many fires we couldn't get any new work done. It's a hard place to get out of.

[Remote mob programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/ "Remote mob programming"). A good guide, not something I can use right now but saving it for future reference.
