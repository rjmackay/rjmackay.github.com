This is an odd question to answer. There are so many places I want to go.. I've even got a <a href="http://www.43places.com/person/rjmackay">list</a> of the top ones.  Real must see ones:

* Yosemite national park
* Machu Picchu
* Bhutan
* .. and the trans-siberian railway. Not really a place.. but something amazing I want to do.

To be honest none of these look that hard yet. I've got a lot of time left, or at least I hope so. But I'm aware how quickly that can all disappear.

Set a deadline: I want to see all of these by 35. At least 2 by 30.<br />
I'd love take the trans-siberian railway on my way back to NZ. This trip home that's unlikely, I don't think I have time/money. But next time..

Here's the thing: I've been to 5 new countries in the past year. But most of the weren't ones I was really excited about. Italy was. The rest were easy options. And I'm more excited about Europe now then I was to start with.

It could be easy to keep going for the easy options and not the ones I'm excited about or a little scared getting to some places could mean less travel overall, but I think it'll be more worthwhile in the end.

Time to start planning and saving...
