First up, Welcome to any new readers who've come over from <a href="http://blog.bwagy.com">Ben Young's blog</a>. As Ben said I try to provide people with insights and <a href="http://blog.robbiemackay.com/category/inspiration/">inspiration</a>, and encourage people to <a href="http://blog.robbiemackay.com/category/pursuing-your-dreams/">live awesome lives</a> and <a href="http://blog.robbiemackay.com/2010/04/11/entrepreneurs-dont-just-start-businesses/">change the world</a>. I don't post to a schedule, but I have a bit of a redesign in the works after which I'll post more regularly.

I'm slowly tweaking my blog, what I write and how I write it. So here's an update about what I'm up to at the moment. I'll keep writing these updates infrequently when theres something interesting to update.

<h3>Moving</h3>

The most major change at the moment, and the one thats occupying a lot of my attention: I'm leaving my amazing job at <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.nz/join/for-pure-nz/">Greenpeace NZ</a> and moving to the UK in June. Complete with a side trip to Penang, Malaysia.



One awesome thing (of many): **I've been amazed how easy it was to save money.**



I thought it would take ages, but when I got serious about it it was easy. I put all my money in once place... discovered I already had $2000 (who knew?). I've cut back expenses by staying with friends and my savings are now on track. I've bought plane tickets and I've got a bit to keep me going till I have work in the UK.



This is a good example of how <a href="http://blog.robbiemackay.com/2010/03/19/on-deploying-early-and-then-tweaking-follow-up-from-redesign-your-career/">just starting</a> is often the hardest part. Once you've created momentum its easy.

<h3>Updates</h3>
