</span></div>
So I modded my laptop a bit yesterday - replaced the keyboard &amp; touchpad with parts out of an identical broken portege. Sooo much nicer to type now.

And then I swapped my battery cos the original one was fried - the replacement isn't much better - about half an hour battery life but oh well.

So here's a photo of the old battery disassembled - I would try replacing the dead cells but I don't think I can get lithium ion cells in NZ :S

Any ideas? (Short of buying a new laptop - cos that's what I should really do, just need money first)

<em>Update: I retreived the battery from the broken Portege and have been running unplugged for about an hour :) So now I've got a working battery - and a semi working backup. Still keen on ideas for reconditioning batteries though.</em>
