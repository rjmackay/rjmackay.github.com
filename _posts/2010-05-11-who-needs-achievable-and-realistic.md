This started as a <a href="http://www.mikeziarko.com/?p=98#comment-7">blog comment</a>, and I've ranted about it at <a href="http://intersect.ning.com">Intersect</a> meetups before. I think its worth highlighting again:

> I cringe every time I hear someone talk about ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a>’ goals… Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Time based.
>
> I would  keep the SMT… but who cares if its Achievable or Realistic?
>
> In fact I’d almost add them as measures in reverse… be unrealistic and aim for what it seems you can’t achieve.. and you might get a surprise when you find yourself achieving it :)

<em><span style="font-weight: normal;">Aside: I've always known SMART as Specific Measurable Achievable Realistic Time-based. But Wikipedia suggests it should have Attainable and Relevant instead. My point still stands however... who cares if its Attainable? Relevance could be useful though.</span></em>
