I'm looking at building an <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a> based Î¼blogging tool - in other words a <a href="http://identi.ca">identi.ca</a> / <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> clone (which is a <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> clone).

I would implement the <a title="openmicroblogging.org" href="http://openmicroblogging.org/">OpenMicroBlogging</a> spec so it could talk to laconi.ca servers.

I'm looking at building it on top of the <a href="http://talk.org">talk.org</a> code (source is on <a title="http://github.com/pelle/talk.org/tree/master" href="http://github.com/pelle/talk.org/tree/master">github</a>). Currently talk.org still needs a lot of work - it has no followers implementation to start with.

If anyone else is interested in joining in to develop this **leave me a comment!
**I'll post updates as to how I got - for now I must get back to writing reports :)
