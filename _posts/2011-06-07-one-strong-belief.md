> It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.
> *- Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance*

The world is powered by passionate people, powerful ideas, and fearless action. What’s one strong belief you possess that isn’t shared by your closest friends or family? What inspires this belief, and what have you done to actively live it?</blockquote>

Being vegetarian? Life is sacred, if you don't have to kill something to eat, don't kill it. I've been vegetarian since Sept 27 2008, so over two years.

This is far from being my strongest belief.. its an expression of many others: that something needs to be done about climate change, that the way we farm is a bit fucked up, being vege is more healthy. But its one decision thats got more resistance from my family than most (though still not much from most of them - love you guys). And one that can get odd reactions from friends.

Has it been worth sticking with? Yes. It reminds me that I can do something I put my mind to. That I don't need others support to do it either. It picks me up at my lowest, as a reminder that I'm still doing a small bit to make the world better.. when I feel a bit useless.

I try not to preach vegetarian-ism. I don't want to create a religion. I don't need others to validate my opinion. I don't need it to be a moral high ground. I don't want to turn it in to one. I try to keep it personal, keep being vege because it works for me. Not because it would be 'bad' to eat meat.
