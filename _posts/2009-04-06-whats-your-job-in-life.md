To see the good in everyone.

That is my job in life...



Why? Because I say so.. Because its what I'm drawn to do.



No matter the person there is something good there, something beautiful...

In their darkest moment when they do their worst to me... I will remember who they are.

I may get angry or upset.. but in the end I will try to see it from their side..

A friend used to refer to this as 'Leadership creating leadership' - seeking to inspire everyone and see everyone as a leader.



If some part of my life isn't working its often because I'm failing to see the good in something or someone..



This isn't to say you have to pick just one thing...I have a few of these. Many of the important things in my life fit into this framework. They're not something someone told me to do, or something I have to do... they are just what I say my life is for.Â I've posted this quote before but I think it fits this post so here it is again:

<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This is the true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one. Being a force of nature instead of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances, complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it what I can.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work, the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got hold of for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: right;">**George Bernard Shaw**</p>

</blockquote>

What's **your** job in life? What are **you** passionate about? What do **you** say you life is for?



Don't think about what you can do or what you think is possible...

**What do you want to do? What do you want your life to be about?**



Now **go**!
