Trying something else: This isn't a great ideas post, or strategy post or anything where I've got it all sorted (..I never really do anyway).

Its been an interesting week. I keep finding myself in familiar but quite old spaces... that is - I haven't been there for a while. This odd feeling of peace and calm, waiting to start an adventure, wanting to just ditch all caution and planning and take off.

It's a feeling I used to get quite often. And it can be a bit frustrating when I can't find an outlet for it.

The interesting thing to notice was how much of a different person I am now... similar old space but different me..

And this time theres some outlets for that feeling... not just yet and with a bit of control... but a direction all the same
