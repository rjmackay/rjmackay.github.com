Follow up from <a href="http://blog.robbiemackay.com/2010/03/03/redesigning-your-career-dont-do-it-all-at-once/">Redesigning your career</a>:

I mentioned getting things moving quickly and then tweaking.

The key here is not to worry if its not perfect - not the perfect job or the perfect business idea, etc.

Just start, get moving, and keep moving towards your vision of perfect.

I don't mean just take any old thing, don't compromise your values or your goals - but don't put them off waiting for everything to line up.

Serendipity might not happen. But you make it happen.
