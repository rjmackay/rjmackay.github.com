I read quite a while back in a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/06/malcolm-is-wrong.html">post</a> by Seth Godin on Chris Anderson's book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Future-Radical-Chris-Anderson/dp/1401322905/">Free</a>, that it doesn't matter if we want Free, it's already here anyway.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"Who cares if we want it? It is."</em></p>

The same is true of markets, capitalism, globalisation, etc. It doesn't matter if they're good or not, or if we want them. They're here. We have to deal with them while they're here (Don't worry it probably won't be forever).



That's why Fairtrade is such a good idea, and micro finance too. They work with what we've already got, to make a positive change in the world.



Hopefully they're the first of many good plans.



<small>This isn't to say that you should always just accept the status quo. But I'm not convinced you can ignore the whole of the current system. **<em>Take the bits you can work with, and refuse the bits that don't work.</em>** Some great successes have come from those who chose to ignore the status quo, but usually only on a few key points - not everything.</small>
