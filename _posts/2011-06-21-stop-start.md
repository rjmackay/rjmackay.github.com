Stop. Start.
Pulled one way then the other.
Just when you decide, you realise you were wrong all along.
Everything is transient.
Everything is serious. Nothing matters.
Life starts now.

Life starts now.
But it already started.
You're going nowhere.
Yet you've come so far already.

Do you recognise this life? Do you know how you got here?
You got you here.
