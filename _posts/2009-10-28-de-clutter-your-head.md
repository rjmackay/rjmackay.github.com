[De-cluttering](http://rowansimpson.com/2007/12/31/de-clutter/) things is great

It creates space for new things

De-cluttering a house, creates a nicer space to live in.. and gives space for things you actually want

Clear out old documents, photos, projects, etc... create space for new ones that you actually want now

De-clutter your head...

This is part of why I blog.

It gets the ideas out of my head,

gets them into the world,

where they can contribute to others...

But it also de-clutters my head

Creating space for new ideas, new thoughts
