<a title="What's your job in life" href="http://blog.robbiemackay.com/2009/04/06/whats-your-job-in-life/">Yesterdays post</a> didn't really sit right with me. I posted it anyway but now I'm calling bullshit.



Life doesn't really have a purpose other than experience and what ever you say matters to you... This may be many things... and this may be similar to what I said yesterday - but one this it certainly isn't is a job.



If you have the pleasure of turning your chosen passion or purpose into your day job - then I hope you'll agree with me. Because now even your day job isn't really a job at all!

<blockquote><em>A Zen Poet said, “A person who is a master in the art of living makes little distinction between their work and their play, their labor and their leisure, their mind and their body, their education and their recreation, their love and their religion. They hardly know which is which and simply pursue their vision of excellence and grace, whatever they do, leaving others to decide whether they are working or playing. To them they are always doing both.”</em></blockquote>

So go, **live life and love life**... but don't treat whatever purpose you've chosen like a bad day job. It may not be easy but it doesnt have to be hard work...



**Enjoy!**
