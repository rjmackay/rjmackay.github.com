I'm looking for work at the moment, and hearing a lot of typical interview questions.

"Tell me about a time you wrote complex code that ran at scale"

... well I can't. I've been at a small organization for 6 years. We've been working hard to iterate on a product and find a fit in the market. It's rough. We've messed up and failed a lot. But none of those failures had anything to do with scale.

"Tell me about a time you wrote beautiful scalable code but the product sucked and no-one used it"

"Tell me about a time you've seen a project delayed by technical perfection on something that wasn't user tested"

"Tell me about a time overengineered software architecture that was 'correct' was also inflexible and slowed down development"

"Tell me about when computer science made no difference, because you weren't talking to users"

"Tell me about a time performance was great, but the user experience was still horrible"
