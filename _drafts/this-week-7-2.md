A collection of technical, management and other thoughts from this week.

## Thinking

I've been on-boarding to a new job the last month, and learning a bunch of new codebases. Reflecting on code review. Using code review for knowledge sharing can be a heated debate sometimes, but one thing I'm noticing at the moment is that - while code review as a teaching tool might be dubious - it can be a great learning tool. 

In particular, I find that I use code review as a learning tool myself and find it really effective. It points me at parts of a codebase I might never have seen before and in the process of figuring out if a chance makes sense, I have to read and understand what's happening. For the musicians out there - it's the equivalent of sight reading.

It's not the same as playing and coding within that codebase, but it goes a long way to being able to reason about what's going on there now and in future.
