A collection of technical, management and other thoughts from this week.

## Thinking

It's frustrating to see so much focus on what will make money, treating making the world better or making things people need as a secondary bonus. Tech generates so many amazing things right now, but also so much waste.

## Reading

[Meritocracy doesn’t exist, and believing it does is bad for you](https://www.fastcompany.com/40510522/meritocracy-doesnt-exist-and-believing-it-does-is-bad-for-you "Meritocracy doesn’t exist, and believing it does is bad for you"). The title says it all really.

[Why software projects take longer than you think](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html). A great write up a possible reason why we're so bad at estimating software projects: People estimate the _median_ completion time well, but not the mean. It'd love to see this confirmed with more data.

[How to Track Your Kids (and Other People's Kids) With the TicTocTrack Watch](https://www.troyhunt.com/how-to-track-your-kids-and-other-peoples-kids-with-the-tictoctrack-watch). A good break down of the security failures of a watch for tracking your kids. I'm with Germany on this one - ban them -  the security risks are too high to consider any device that tracks children.

[A way to do CSS for applications](https://macwright.org/2019/02/09/tachyons-css.html). Nice and simple. I might try this on my next project.
