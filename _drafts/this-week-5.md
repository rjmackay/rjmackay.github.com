A collection of technical, management and other thoughts from this week.

Life happened and I've missed a couple weeks but I'm back at writing these. 

## Thinking

### Getting satisfaction in open-ended work

I changed roles in January from a management role to a developer role. Partly because I wanted to learn and grow my technical skills again. But also I just wanted to feel like I'd done something at the end of each day.

As a manager, I often finished the day wondering what I'd done and feeling like maybe I didn't actually do anything useful at all today. It's only recently I've realised thats a common experience for many new managers.

I've also recently found myself in a similar place again. I'm not managing a team yet, but we're in a phase of very open-ended exploratory work (read: pivoting). Once again, it's hard to tell if what I did today was useful. Did I read anything that gave me insight into the product? into customers needs? into the market? Even if I did, was that enough? Is it actually moving us closer to a profitable business.

I'm just ... not sure. In abscence of a concrete deliverable ie. a working bit of code, it's hard to see my impact.

## Reading

[Satisfaction and progress in open ended work](https://blog.andymatuschak.org/post/159979927467/satisfaction-and-progress-in-open-ended-work)

[How to Make Sense of Your Impact When You're No Longer Coding](https://blog.coleadership.com/how-to-make-sense-of-your-impact-when-youre-no-longer-coding/ "How to Make Sense of Your Impact When You're No Longer Coding"). 

[Hiring and the market for lemons](https://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/ "Hiring and the market for lemons"). An interesting analysis of broken hiring practices. I'm not sure I agree with all of it but it's worth a read.

[How not to disagree](http://boz.com/articles/disagree.html "How not to disagree"). A good piece about how to handle managing a team through changes you don't agree with. 

[Fire fixation](https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/ "https://lethain.com/fire-fixation/"). I've definitely had teams stuck in a place of fighting so many fires we couldn't get any new work done. It's a hard place to get out of.

[Remote mob programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/ "Remote mob programming"). A good guide, not something I can use right now but saving it for future reference.
