I have 10+ years of experience building full stack web apps, with a focus on non profits and companies with a social purpose. I've spent the last 4 years working remotely for [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com), leading development on our flagship application, and now managing the distributed development team.

I have taken projects from day zero through to launch, and iterating beyond. I enjoy both carefully architecting a system for the future, and just sprinting to launch when needed. I like to work close to users, be driven by their needs and deliver a great experience.

I tend to a collaborative working style, but enjoy the uninterrupted periods of independent work.

## Skills & Experience
* Managing a distributed development team, defining tech direction and development process.
* Full stack web development, primarily in PHP and JS (AngularJS)
* Object orientated architecture design and programming, including MVC frameworks, SOLID principles, Clean Architecture.
* Leading an open source project, and working with the wider user and developer community.
* Automated/continuous deployment setup.
* Some technologies I've used include: PHP, Javascript, Sass, Python, Laravel, AngularJS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Nginx, Docker, Ansible, Git.. I've even spent some time hacking on FirefoxOS.
