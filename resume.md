I have 10+ years of experience building full stack web apps, with a focus on non profits and companies with a social purpose. I've spent the last 4 years working remotely for [Ushahidi](https://www.ushahidi.com), leading development on our flagship application, and now managing the distributed development team.

I have taken projects from day zero through to launch, and iterating beyond. I enjoy both carefully architecting a system for the future, and just sprinting to launch when needed. I like to work close to users, be driven by their needs and deliver a great experience.

I tend to a collaborative working style, but enjoy the uninterrupted periods of independent work.
